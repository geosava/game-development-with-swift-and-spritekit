## Instructor: [Derek Jenkens][instructor url]

If you are anything like me you were probably interested in computer games when you were younger. I can still remember spening an awful lot of time wondering how these games were made and dreaming about one day becoming a game developer. So I got into software development. Well, years went by and I found myself doing more and more enterprise style applications, but always wondering what it would be like to get back to what made me interested in computers in the first place. Well if you were like me, this is your chance. In this course we are going to re-ignite that passion for games by learning the basics of iOS game development with SpriteKit.
